# Pocketix Ecosystem

Welcome to the Pocketix Ecosystem â€” a suite of tools and libraries designed for automating smart home and IoT devices. The Pocketix project includes various components that work together to provide a comprehensive visual programming environment for creating automation scripts, device management, and integration with IoT systems.

## Overview

The Pocketix Ecosystem enables the automation of smart devices through visual programming. With both block- and form-based editors, users can design automation workflows using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface without the need for coding experience. The ecosystem is designed to integrate with smart home devices, IoT sensors, and cloud platforms, enabling powerful automation solutions.

- **pocketix-react**: A React-based visual programming editor for creating smart home automation workflows.
- **pocketixng**: An Angular-based editor for designing automation rules and controlling devices in the IoT ecosystem.
- **Pocketix Node**: A backend module that interprets Pocketix V1 programs and sends commands to devices, designed for simulation and testing.
- **Pocketix Node Core**: A monorepo containing backend services, databases, and frontend applications to support IoT and smart device automation.

## Features

- âœ… Visual programming language editors for smart home and IoT automation
- âœ… Drag-and-drop interface with condition/action configuration
- âœ… Block-based and form-based UI for designing automation workflows
- âœ… Integration with smart devices and extensible architecture
- âœ… Supports the Pocketix v1 language version
- âœ… Backend services for IoT device management, including time-series storage and serverless functions
- âœ… Scalable architecture designed for real-world IoT applications

## Usage
- **pocketix-react** and **pocketixng** offer a user-friendly interface for designing automation rules using visual blocks. You can drag and drop blocks, configure their parameters through forms, and integrate smart home devices into the workflow.
- **Pocketix Node** provides the runtime environment for interpreting automation scripts, executing them in a dry-run mode, and interacting with IoT devices or simulating actions.
- **Pocketix Node Core** houses the backend services and databases that power the entire ecosystem, allowing for scalable and cloud-integrated device management.
